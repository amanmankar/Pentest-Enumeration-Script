# Pentest-Enumeration-Script
This script makes use of different enumeration tools such as NMAP, Dirb, Nikto, etc and automates the process of enumeration by taking a single input of IP address. It includes nmap script scans for smtp, ms-sql, smb, ssh, ssl and http. For websites that run on http as well as https, multi threading is used for running Dirb and Nikto scans on both which saves a lot of time. Dirb will be removed in the future when Dirsearch or Gobuster is implemented.

Usage: python3 EnumScript.py

It makes use of the nmap output and automatically runs relevent nmap scripts for the port found. 

Future implementation consists of:
1. Masscan - faster port detection.
2. Automated Metasploit lookup based on nmap output.
3. Gobuster - faster directory bruteforce.
